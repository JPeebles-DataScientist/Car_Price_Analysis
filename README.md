# Analysis of Used Car Prices

## Overview
This project delves into a comprehensive dataset of used cars to uncover the factors that significantly influence their pricing. The goal is to equip a used car dealership with strategic insights that will help them align their inventory with market demands and consumer preferences.

## Project Objectives
- To identify and analyze the attributes that impact the prices of used cars.
- To provide actionable recommendations to a used car dealership to enhance their inventory management based on our findings.

## Data
The data for this project is sourced from a Kaggle dataset that includes detailed information on approximately 426,000 used cars. The dataset features variables such as price, make, model, year, condition, and mileage, which are integral to our analysis.

## Methodological Approach
Our approach adheres to the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), which includes the following phases:
1. **Business Understanding**: Defining the scope and objectives of the project.
2. **Data Understanding**: Conducting preliminary data exploration and identifying data quality issues.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
4. **Modeling**: Applying statistical models to understand how various factors affect car prices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance.
6. **Deployment**: Providing recommendations based on the model results.

## Key Insights
We uncovered several critical insights about the used car market, notably how the age and mileage of cars inversely affect their pricing. Cars from reputed brands and those better maintained also tend to retain more value.
